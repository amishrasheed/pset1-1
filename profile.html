      <h2>Why I want to take this class: </h2>
      <p>I majored in computer science during my undergrad so I have experience programming and creating web applications. However, 
          I want to gain experience creating a full stack application from start to finish and fill in gaps in my knowledge. This class 
          will hopefully help me develop my skills, gain more confidence, and address any areas of weakness. I have experience programming in java and python, using 
          frameworks such as spring, and flask. One of my personal goals for this class is to focus on javascript since I don't have extensive
          experience programming using Js.

      <h3><a href="https://www.rasanyc.com/"> Rasanyc: one of my favorite restaurants</a></h3>
      <h4>This is a japenese and Malaysian fusion restaurant in New York City with an assorted menu. 
          They have plenty of seating for a restaurant in New York and a great ambiance overall. The food is delicious, and
          I particularly enjoy their Satay Combo, Mee Goreng, and Udon. They also have a fun cocktail menu.

              This is Chicken Pulao, a type of rice pilaf dish commonly served in Pakistani households. The dish is traditionally made with basmati rice, spices, potatoes, and meat. 
              It can be eaten as is or served with a curry or raita (yogurt based sauce). I usually eat it as is with some raita.

                <td>Leo Tolstoy</td>
                <td>"Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men."

                <td>Oscar Wilde</td>
                <td>"In this celebrated work Wilde forged a devastating portrait of the effects of evil and debauchery on a young aesthete in late-19th-century England. Combining elements of the Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, the book centers on a striking premise: As Dorian Gray sinks into a life of crime and gross sensuality, his body retains perfect youth and vigor while his recently painted portrait grows day by day into a hideous record of evil, which he must keep hidden from the world."

                <td>Jane Austen</td>
                <td>"The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England."

He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck."
